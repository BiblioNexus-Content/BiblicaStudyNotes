## 3 John 1:1–15 (id: 133017)

John called himself the elder. He may have been talking about his age or about being a church elder.

He was full of joy because his friend Gaius’ spiritual life was going well. This meant that Gaius was following Jesus faithfully.

In 1 John 3:18 John wrote about believers putting their faith and love into action. Gaius did that by welcoming and helping believers who were traveling. In this way he supported people who spread the good news about Jesus.

This was very different from what a man named Diotrephes did. Diotrephes ruled over others in the church. This went against Peter’s instructions for church leaders (1 Peter 5:3\).

Diotrephes told lies about John. John planned to speak to Diotrephes about what he was doing wrong. His plan agreed with what Paul taught about correcting church elders in 1 Timothy 5:20\.

John wanted Gaius to avoid doing evil and instead to do good. Demetrius was an example of a believer who did good. He was faithful to the truth about Jesus.
