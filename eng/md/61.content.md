## 2 Peter 1:1–11 (id: 133003)

The believers that Peter wrote to had received the message of the good news.

They had been rescued from evil in the world. God had given them everything they needed to follow Jesus’ example.

They could live a godly and holy life like Jesus did. They needed to keep learning and growing in the faith.

Peter made it clear that this required effort and hard work. He listed seven ways believers should keep growing. This list is like Paul’s list of the fruit of the Holy Spirit in Galatians 5:22–23\.

As believers know Jesus more and more, they become more and more like him. This is how they share in God’s nature. Growing in the faith allows believers to be useful as Jesus’ kingdom spreads on earth. Jesus’ kingdom is the kingdom of God.

## 2 Peter 1:12–21 (id: 133004)

Peter believed that he would die soon. It was important for him to remind the believers of the truth about Jesus. He explained two ways that he and other apostles knew the truth.

First, they had been with Jesus while he lived and served on earth. Peter, James and John had seen Jesus’ glory in a way that others hadn’t. They saw it with their own eyes when they were on the mountain with Jesus (Matthew 17:1–8\).

Second, the apostles understood that there were many prophecies about Jesus in the Old Testament. The prophets hadn’t made up the words. They had spoken the words that the Holy Spirit gave them. These prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus’ life.

One of these was spoken by Balaam. Balaam talked about a star coming from the family line of Jacob (Numbers 24:17\).

Peter called Jesus the Morning Star. This was a way to talk about how Jesus brings God’s light into the world. Peter said that the world will be a dark place until Jesus’ return.

## 2 Peter 2:1–9 (id: 133005)

Peter warned the believers not to trust teachers who taught things that weren’t true. False teachers didn’t want what was good for the believers. They wanted to take advantage of Jesus’ followers.

Peter made it clear that God would stop them and bring judgement against them. He used three examples from the Old Testament. These examples showed that God knows how to judge and punish evil spiritual beings.

The same is true for ungodly people. The examples also showed that God knows how to protect godly people.

## 2 Peter 2:10–22 (id: 133006)

In chapter 1, Peter talked about certain believers. They had forgotten that their past sins (sin) had been washed away.

Washing away sins is a way to talk about being forgiven. Here Peter talked more about these believers. They followed sinful desires on purpose.

The main thing about these believers was that they hated to be under authority. They didn’t want to humbly serve Jesus as their Master. They sought freedom to do whatever they wanted.

Peter made it clear that this wasn’t real freedom. It only made these believers slaves to the evil desires that controlled them. They served sin as their master instead of serving Jesus. Peter wrote clearly about God’s judgement against these people.

## 2 Peter 3:1–10 (id: 133007)

Jesus had promised to return to earth. For many years after Jesus’ resurrection, believers expected that he would return very soon.

Then some believers began to doubt that he would come back. Some people made fun of believers for thinking that Jesus would return. Peter explained that God isn’t slow to act or unable to keep his promises. Instead, he is patient. God chooses to wait. He wants people to repent and to turn away from their sins. He is giving everyone the opportunity to turn back to him.

Peter described judgement day coming like a thief. Jesus had also talked about it like that in Luke 12:39\. Peter described God’s judgement like fire that destroys the heavens and the earth.

He was talking about the kind of fire that melts gold and makes it pure. The book of Malachi also talks about this kind of fire (Malachi 3:1–3\). The fire would burn away everything in the heavens and the earth that opposed God.

## 2 Peter 3:11–18 (id: 133008)

Peter told the believers how they were to live while they waited for Jesus to return. They were to live holy lives. This included being at peace with God.

It included staying away from false teachers. Instead they must hold on to true teaching like Peter and Paul taught. Peter’s teachings agreed with Paul’s teachings.

Holy living included knowing Jesus the Lord and Saviour more and more. Then believers would feel God’s grace more deeply every day.

The believers were to do all these things as they looked forward to Jesus’ return. Jesus isn’t coming to destroy the world. He is going to judge it and make it pure. That is why Peter spoke about a new heaven and a new earth. He was talking about the new creation. Believers must wait with hope and patience for God to keep this promise.
