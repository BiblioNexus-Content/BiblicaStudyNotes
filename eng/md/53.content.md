## 2 Thessalonians 1:1–12 (id: 132944)

The believers in Thessalonica were being treated badly for serving the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul thanked God that they didn’t give up.

He thanked God that they kept growing in faith and love even while they suffered. Paul used them as an example to encourage other churches. It was clear that the Thessalonians brought glory to Jesus by being faithful witnesses.

Yet their lives were full of trouble because of people who opposed their faith. Paul comforted them and gave them hope. Upon Jesus’ return to earth there will be a judgement day. God will stop people’s evil actions.

The people who treated the Thessalonians badly refused to accept that Jesus is Lord. In this way they refused to be part of the kingdom of God. Paul told the Thessalonian believers about his prayer for them.

He prayed that God would continue to work in them and to bless their good desires. The Thessalonians made every effort to do good based on their faith in Jesus. God’s power and grace made good things happen because of their efforts.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 (id: 132945)

Paul didn’t want the Thessalonians to be concerned that the day of the Lord had already come. He made it clear that Jesus hadn’t yet returned to earth.

He described some of what would happen before Jesus comes back. The power of sin will be allowed to be fully at work. Nothing will hold evil back or protect God’s world from it.

A man of sin will oppose God and will trick many people. Many people will choose to be fooled by the man of sin and by Satan. Satan is another name for the devil. God will allow these people to be fooled since they hate the truth about Jesus.

Then Jesus the true God will return to earth. He will destroy the man of sin and everything that opposes God.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:13–3:5 (id: 132946)

The Thessalonians weren’t like the people who choose to be fooled. They believed the truth about who Jesus is. They accepted the love, hope and grace that God gave them.

God protected them from someone Paul called the evil one. That is another way of talking about the devil and evil spiritual beings.

Paul reminded the Thessalonians that God is powerful. God gave them strength and filled them with his love. So Paul urged them to stay strong in their faith. He urged them to keep living a holy life.

He begged the Thessalonians to pray for him and for those who worked with him. Even though many people opposed Paul, he wanted to keep spreading the message about Jesus.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:6–18 (id: 132947)

Paul did different kinds of work. As an apostle, he shared the good news about Jesus with others. He didn’t receive money for this.

He also worked with his hands to earn what he needed to live. Those who travelled with Paul also did both kinds of work. That was the example they had taught the Thessalonians. Yet some in the church had stopped doing any work. People who belong to Jesus must work hard to earn what they need. And they must never stop doing what is good.

Paul wanted the Thessalonians to continue living in the ways he had taught them. Paul’s letters always ended in his own handwriting. He did this to help the believers trust his teaching.
