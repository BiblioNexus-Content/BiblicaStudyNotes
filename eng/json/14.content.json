    "content": "<p>2 Chronicles continues the story of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> recorded in 1 Chronicles.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108473\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Solomon</span> became <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">king</span> after <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108449\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">David</span>.</p><p>In 2 Chronicles the stories about Solomon tell only of his faithfulness to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span>. They don’t describe the times when he was unfaithful and worshipped <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108284\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">false gods</span>. Those stories are recorded in 2 Kings.</p><p>2 Chronicles shows how Solomon followed David’s example. He followed David’s instructions about the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span> of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108333\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">priests</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108343\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Levites</span>. And he followed David’s instructions about building the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span> on <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108505\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Moriah</span>.</p><p>Solomon recognised that the temple was nothing more than a building. It was a place where the Israelites could offer <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108256\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrifices</span> to God. God is so great that no place on earth or <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108201\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heaven</span> can hold him. Yet the temple was the place where <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God chose</span> to put his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108225\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">name</span>. God had talked about a special place for his name in Deuteronomy chapters 12 to 14. God putting his name somewhere was a sign. It was a sign that people could be aware of his presence in a special way.</p><p>Solomon gave the Israelites an example of how to pray (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayer</span>) to God. He used his body and his words as he prayed. Solomon was on his knees and lifted his hands toward heaven. This was how he showed that he was humble and that he worshipped God. It showed that he needed God’s help and that he trusted God to answer him. Solomon understood that God knew what was in his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108419\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heart</span>. God answered by sending fire from heaven to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108285\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">altar</span>. This showed that God paid attention to Solomon’s prayer. God promised that his name, his eyes and his heart would always be at the temple. This meant that he would always listen to his people and help them. He would do this if they were humble and prayed. God would do this if they turned away from doing evil and depended on him.</p><p>When the people saw the fire, they worshipped God and thanked him. They understood that the fire was a sign of his faithful love for them. Even an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108369\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">outsider</span> like the queen of Sheba recognised that God loved Israel. God wanted to take good care of his people (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span>). He planned to do this through wise kings from David’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108220\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">family line</span>. That was part of God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108466\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant with David</span>. The kings were to worship God faithfully and do what was fair and right.</p>",

    "content": "<p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108483\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jehoshaphat</span> followed David’s example as king during his entire rule. He worshipped only God and followed the Mount Sinai covenant. He made sure that everyone he ruled over was taught the Law of Moses.</p><p>He appointed <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108420\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judges</span> all throughout the southern kingdom. The judges helped people understand how to apply the law. They decided between hard cases fairly and with <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108325\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">wisdom</span>.</p><p>Jehoshaphat got rid of everything that had to do with worshipping false gods. These were things that every king was supposed to do. These things helped God’s people live as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108337\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kingdom of priests</span> and a holy nation.</p><p>Jehoshaphat acted wisely when the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108397\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Moabites</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108412\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ammonites</span> and people from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108411\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Edom</span> were about to attack. He led the people of the southern kingdom to ask God for help. All together they went without eating food. This is called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108456\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">fasting</span>. It showed how serious they were about praying to God for help.</p><p>This was very different from how people made decisions before kings ruled in Israel. During the time of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108430\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">12 judges</span>, the people did anything they thought was right (Judges 21:25). Jehoshaphat was the kind of king that the book of Judges showed was needed.</p><p>Jehoshaphat’s prayer showed that he was humble. He trusted God to bring judgement against those who attacked them. God answered his prayer by sending a message through a Levite from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108506\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Asaph</span>’s family line. The message encouraged the people to have hope because God was with them. The people worshipped and praised God when they heard the message. That is how they marched into battle. People singing praises to God went in front of the soldiers. They didn’t have to fight because God caused the other armies to destroy one another.</p><p>The people groups around the southern kingdom noticed the way Jehoshaphat’s people lived. They noticed the ways God protected the southern kingdom. What they noticed made the other nations become afraid of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span>. This meant that they respected God and wouldn’t attack his people. So the southern kingdom enjoyed the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108379\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant blessings</span> of peace and rest.</p><p>When Jehoshaphat did foolish things, prophets spoke against him. He listened to them and didn’t punish them. This happened when Jehoshaphat <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108206\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">married</span> a daughter of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108484\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ahab</span> and joined Ahab in a battle. It also happened when Jehoshaphat made an agreement about trade with the northern kingdom.</p>",

The changes included the king and the people giving a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108382\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">tenth</span> of everything they had. They gave it freely to provide for the priests and Levites. This allowed the Levites and priests to spend their time leading worship and teaching the people.</p><p>Worshipping God faithfully included celebrating the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108372\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">feasts</span> the way <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108300\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Moses</span> had taught the Israelites to. The people celebrated the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108366\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Day of Atonement</span>. That is the day when sins were paid for.</p><p>Hezekiah wanted all <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108286\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">12 tribes</span> of Israel to celebrate the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108317\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Passover Feast</span> together again. That hadn’t happened since Solomon was king. Hezekiah invited all Israelites left in the land of the northern kingdom. These people had been left behind after the Assyrian army took control of the northern kingdom. They hadn’t been forced to live in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108495\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">exile</span> in Assyria.</p><p>Some people from a few tribes went to Jerusalem for the feast. Some outsiders living among them also went. Even people who hadn’t made themselves pure and clean could be part of the feast. This was because they wanted to worship God with all their heart. Hezekiah’s prayer showed that he understood something about God. God cares deeply about people being committed to him in their heart. God <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108281\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">forgave</span> the people’s sins and healed them.</p><p>Many years before God had promised Solomon that he would do this. He would forgive his people and heal their land. He would do this if they turned away from evil. He would do it if they were humble and prayed to him (2 Chronicles 7:14).</p>",

But any Israelites who still lived there were allowed to worship the true God. So were the outsiders who lived there.</p><p>Josiah had the temple repaired. He made sure that the Book of the Law was read to the people. This was a copy of the Law of Moses. He learnt about the covenant curses while reading about the Mount Sinai covenant. He hoped to stop the covenant curses from coming. So while he was king, all 12 tribes of Israel obeyed God. Those in the southern kingdom and those left in the northern kingdom followed God faithfully.</p><p>When he was older, Josiah made a foolish decision to fight against Egypt’s army.
