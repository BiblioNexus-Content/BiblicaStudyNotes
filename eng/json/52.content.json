They must warn those who are doing wrong and be patient with one another. They must help and encourage one another. These and many more things are included in doing what is good for each other.</p><p>Believers also receive help from God. Believers can’t make themselves holy. God’s Spirit does the work inside of them. Believers can trust God to do his work in them.
