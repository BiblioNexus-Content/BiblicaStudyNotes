This period was described in the book of Judges. It was before the nation of Israel was led by <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kings</span>.</p><p>The story of Ruth isn’t about leaders or kings. It’s about God’s work in an ordinary humble family. Naomi was an Israelite from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108442\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Bethlehem</span>. She and her family couldn’t grow enough food on their land. There wasn’t enough food anywhere in their area in Israel. So Naomi and her family decided to move to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108397\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Moab</span>.</p><p>Yet many sad things happened to Naomi. Her husband and two sons died in Moab. Naomi felt that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> had made her life bitter. She returned to Bethlehem when there was enough food there. She returned feeling empty. This was how she described life without her husband and sons. But her daughter-in-law Ruth went with her.</p><p>Ruth left her own family, her country and the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108284\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">false gods</span> that her people worshipped. In Israel, Ruth was considered an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108369\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">outsider</span> because she was from Moab. Yet Ruth was fully committed to Naomi, to the people of Israel and to God.</p>",
