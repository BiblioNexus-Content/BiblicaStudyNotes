He had tried to visit them many times but had always been kept from going.</p><p>So he wrote a letter to encourage them with the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108043\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">good news</span> about <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span>. Paul was an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108053\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">apostle</span>. He served Jesus <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108098\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Christ</span> the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108329\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108527\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Messiah</span>.</p><p>This means that he followed Jesus’ example of being a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108059\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">leader who serves</span>. Paul’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span> was to preach the good news to both <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108547\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Gentiles</span>.</p><p>Jesus was a Jew, and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> had made promises about him in the Jewish Scriptures. The Scriptures are <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s word</span>. God kept these promises when he raised Jesus from the dead.</p><p>Jesus’ <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108568\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">resurrection</span> showed God’s power to save both Jews and Gentiles. God has the power to save everyone through Jesus’ <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108256\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrifice</span>. This is the good news!</p><p>When people believe this good news, it shows that they have <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108232\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">faith</span> in God. Having faith means being committed to God and trusting him. Those who have faith are made <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108254\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">right with God</span>.</p>",

Believers must show love for others as they wait for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108065\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus’ return</span> to earth.</p><p>Paul compared this time of waiting to waking up in the morning from sleep. The nighttime was when people did evil things before they started following Jesus. The daytime is when Jesus returns to earth and people obey him completely.</p><p>Paul wanted believers to start living now the way they will live when Jesus returns. Paul described this as putting Jesus on like he is clothing that they wear. This means that believers must be close to Jesus like clothing is close to their skin. It also means that others can see that believers are following Jesus faithfully.</p>",
