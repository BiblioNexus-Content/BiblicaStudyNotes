Paul thanked <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> that they didn’t give up.</p><p>He thanked God that they kept growing in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108232\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">faith</span> and love even while they suffered. Paul used them as an example to encourage other <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108096\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">churches</span>. It was clear that the Thessalonians brought <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108348\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">glory</span> to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span> by being faithful witnesses.</p><p>Yet their lives were full of trouble because of people who opposed their faith.

God will stop people’s evil actions.</p><p>The people who treated the Thessalonians badly refused to accept that Jesus is <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108329\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span>. In this way they refused to be part of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108561\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kingdom of God</span>. Paul told the Thessalonian believers about his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayer</span> for them.</p><p>He prayed that God would continue to work in them and to bless their good desires. The Thessalonians made every effort to do good based on their faith in Jesus. God’s power and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108235\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">grace</span> made good things happen because of their efforts.</p>",
