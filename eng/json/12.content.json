    "content": "<p>The story of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> recorded in 1 Kings is continued in 2 Kings.</p><p>The nation of Israel had divided into the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108479\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">northern kingdom</span> and the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108480\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">southern kingdom</span>. The northern kingdom was called Israel and the southern kingdom was called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108291\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Judah</span>.</p><p>In the northern kingdom, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108486\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Elijah</span> spoke messages from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> against King Ahaziah. Both Ahaziah and Joram worshipped <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108284\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">false gods</span> like <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108476\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jeroboam</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108484\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ahab</span> had done.</p><p>Before God took Elijah to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108201\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heaven</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108487\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Elisha</span> asked for a double share of Elijah’s spirit. Elisha wasn’t talking about the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108462\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">spiritual</span> part of Elijah. He was talking about the power of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108388\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit</span> in Elijah’s life and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span>. This was how Elisha showed that he wanted to serve God as a faithful <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108416\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophet</span>.</p><p>Like Elijah, Elisha served families in Israel and served the groups of prophets. He also served the leaders of Israel and of other nations. Elisha helped a woman from Shunem with her son and with her land. He helped the prophets with problems like debt, lost items and having enough food. He helped soldiers and officials from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108434\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Aram</span>. God did many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108305\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">miracles</span> through Elisha. One of these was to heal <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108488\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Naaman</span> of his skin disease. This showed Naaman that Israel’s God is the true God.</p><p>God protected Elisha from Aram’s soldiers by making them blind. Then Elisha protected Aram’s soldiers. Elisha had Israel’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">king</span> feed the soldiers instead of killing them. Elisha was very sad when he gave a message to an Aramean officer named Hazael. Later Hazael would do many evil things against the Israelites. Elisha served Israel’s king by warning him of where Aram’s army was going to attack. He also served the king by <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108399\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophesying</span> about how God would take care of the Israelites.</p><p>Elisha prophesied about this when Joram, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108483\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jehoshaphat</span> and the king of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108411\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Edom</span> attacked <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108397\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Moab</span>. God rescued the armies by sending water in the desert. Elisha also prophesied when the Israelites in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108489\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Samaria</span> were about to die of hunger. He made it clear that God would rescue the city by the next morning. God did this by making Aram’s army hear the noise of chariots and horses. The noise scared them and they ran away.</p><p>God used chariots and horses made of fire to protect Elisha. These were <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108423\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">spiritual beings</span> and people could only see them if God allowed them to. They were one way that God took care of his people (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108302\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span>).</p>",

This included Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam the second and Zechariah.

Instead, he trusted the king of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108493\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Assyria</span>. This led Ahaz to make changes to how people worshipped God in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span>.

Hundreds of years earlier <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108300\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Moses</span> had warned the people about all of these things.</p><p>God sent many prophets to warn the kings and the people to turn back to him. These prophets were Elijah, Elisha, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108477\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ahijah</span> and many others. Yet the rulers and people of the northern kingdom refused to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108332\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worship only God</span>. They refused to trust him to provide everything they needed. They refused to live as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108337\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kingdom of priests</span> and a holy nation.</p><p>Finally, God allowed the worst of the covenant curses to come on them. This happened in the years 723 and 722 <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108494\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">BC</span> when Hoshea was king. The king of Assyria attacked the northern kingdom and took control of Samaria. The Assyrians forced many Israelites to leave the land God had promised to give <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108243\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Abraham</span>. The Assyrians brought other people groups to live in Samaria instead.</p><p>Many years earlier God had commanded the Israelites to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108409\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">drive out</span> the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108246\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Canaanites</span>.
