    "content": "<p>Paul described different kinds of church leaders in Ephesus. Some did the work of deacons. All leaders were to set an example about how to think, speak and act.</p><p>Paul listed ten things that they must do and five things that they mustn’t do. This is like the list Paul wrote about church leaders in Titus 1:1–9. Their minds must be centred on the truth about who Jesus is. Their words must be honest and true and helpful to others. Their actions must be respected by believers and unbelievers.</p><p>They must be faithful in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108206\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">marriage</span> if they are married. They must be wise parents if they have children. They must be constantly growing stronger in their faith. They must be honest about money and not cheat people. They must control themselves. They mustn’t drink too much alcohol. They must manage the things they own well. They must be gentle and humble as they serve and lead people.</p><p>Paul explained to Timothy why he wrote these instructions about church leaders. He wanted believers to know how they should act. Leaders should teach this by the way they live. The church is <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108045\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s family</span>. It shows everyone how God wants human beings to live. The church shows everyone the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108145\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">mystery of Christ</span>. This mystery is that Jesus is the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108526\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Son of God</span>.</p>",
