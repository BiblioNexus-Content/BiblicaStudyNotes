This means that Jesus is the Word of God or <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108200\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s Word</span>. It also means that Jesus has <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108569\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">eternal life</span>. Death couldn’t destroy him.</p><p>While Jesus lived on earth, John and the other <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108053\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">apostles</span> knew him very well. In this way, John and the 12 disciples (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108040\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">disciple</span>) shared life with Jesus.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> wants all people to share life with him. Sharing life with God means to know God. It means living in friendship with him and being filled with his love. It is another way to describe sharing in God’s nature (2 Peter 1:4). This is possible when people walk in God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108546\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">light</span>.</p><p>People walk in God’s light when they trust Jesus to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108281\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">forgive</span> their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sins</span>. They must recognise that they think, speak and do things that are sinful. They must confess this to God. God always forgives people who <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repent</span> of their sin.</p><p>Sin is like <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108039\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">darkness</span> that covers the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108215\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">world</span>. Being forgiven for sin allows people to be in the light. Walking in God’s light also means obeying God and following Jesus’ example.</p>",

This will happen when Jesus returns to earth. Believers don’t know exactly what eternal life will be like. But they know they will be like Jesus. Because of this they follow Jesus’ example while they are alive on earth. This means that they <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108355\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">love God</span>, obey him and love others.</p><p>Jesus <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108256\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrificed</span> himself out of love for others.

God’s Spirit teaches that God’s Son has a human body. Those who believe this have life from Jesus.</p><p>God’s children can be sure about having God’s love and having life from Jesus. This helps them be bold as they pray to God and obey him. John encouraged the believers to obey God’s commands. They could do this because they had won the spiritual fight over the world. This meant that Jesus had set them free from the control of the devil. The devil controls the world by keeping people slaves to sin. Believers have faith in Jesus and believe that he has set them free.</p><p>That is why God’s children don’t keep sinning again and again on purpose. If they do this it becomes sin that leads to death. This means that people choose to continue sinning and refuse to receive life from Jesus. Instead, God’s children pray and are forgiven by God.
