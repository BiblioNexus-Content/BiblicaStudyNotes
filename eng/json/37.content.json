    "content": "<p>Many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> returned from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108498\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Babylon</span> to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108291\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Judah</span>. They were supposed to build another <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span> in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108464\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>.</p><p>First they rebuilt their homes. Then they started farming again. But there wasn’t enough rain. Their crops didn’t produce enough food. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108510\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Haggai</span> explained why. Not having enough rain or food were sometimes signs of God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span>. They were part of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108380\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant curses</span>.</p><p>In Haggai’s time <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> allowed these covenant curses to come to the Jews. Covenant curses came when <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> were not faithful to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108327\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. In the prophet <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108570\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Hosea</span>’s messages God had talked about ending the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108327\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai</span> covenant (Hosea 1:9).</p><p>Many Jews thought that God ended the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span> when he sent them into <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108495\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">exile</span>. But God had promised that he would continue the covenant. He would continue it with the people left alive after the time of exile. Many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108416\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophets</span> had announced this.</p><p>God still wanted the Jews to live faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant after the exile. This meant that they would live the way God taught them to live. They would treat others according to God’s rules. And they would worship God the way he taught them to in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108335\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Law of Moses</span>. Because the Jews weren’t doing these things, the covenant curses had come. The Jews needed to change their ways and to obey God. They needed to rebuild the temple. This would show that they had respect for God. It would show that they believed he is the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span> who rules over all.</p>",

But other people groups living around them forced them to stop building. Government officials also forced them to stop for around 16 years. This story is recorded in the book of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108513\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ezra</span> chapters 1 through 4.</p><p>Rebuilding the temple was something that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108560\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Daniel</span> had <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayed</span> about (Daniel 9:17–19). Daniel understood that the temple was a sign of God’s honour. God didn’t need a temple built by <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108202\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">human beings</span>. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108473\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Solomon</span> had made that clear when the first temple was built (1 Kings 8:27). And people didn’t need a temple in order to worship God. The stories of Daniel and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108555\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ezekiel</span> made that clear. Daniel and Ezekiel served God faithfully in Babylon after the temple was destroyed.</p><p>But <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108229\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God chose</span> to use the temple as a sign of his presence with people on earth. It was a sign that God wanted all people to worship him and obey him (Isaiah 2:1–5). Zerubbabel and Joshua listened to Haggai’s message in the second year that Darius was king. These leaders obeyed God. They continued rebuilding the temple. So did all the people. Those were the people left alive after the southern kingdom’s time of judgement. They were able to do this because God was with them. This meant that the people could trust that God was present with them. It also meant that God was taking action to help them. God stirred up their spirits. This meant that God gave them the desire and the ability to do the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span>. The story about continuing to rebuild the temple is recorded in Ezra chapters 5 and 6.</p>",
