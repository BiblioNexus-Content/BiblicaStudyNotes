It didn’t matter if they were important leaders, priests or common people. The people were responsible for bringing their sacrifices and offerings to the holy tent.

The smell also reminded <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108302\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> that God provided the good things in their lives.</p>",
