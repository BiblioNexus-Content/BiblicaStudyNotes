    "content": "<p>In this section of the book of Proverbs, a father speaks to his son. The father and the mother have taught the son how to live well. They have taught him with their words and with the example of how they live. The father urges the son to live according to what they have taught him.</p><p>The advice from the parents is about many things. It’s about being humble and trusting God completely. It’s about the son guarding his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108419\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heart</span>. The son’s heart is where he makes decisions. The advice is about the son saying no when he is tempted to do evil. This includes stealing and getting rich in ways that aren’t honest. It includes refusing to share with others. It includes lying, being jealous and having sex with another man’s wife.</p><p>The advice is also about becoming wise. People begin to be wise when they respect God. Wisdom is something that God gives. He wants all <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108202\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">human beings</span> to have it. God gives wisdom freely to those who ask for it. This is made clear in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108204\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">poems</span> about wisdom and in James 1:5.</p><p>Wisdom is described as a woman who calls out to everyone in public. She invites everyone to come to her house and share in a feast. This means that people listen to wisdom and obey wise teachings. That is how people get wisdom. Obeying wise instructions leads to health, riches, success and honour. That is the pattern of life that the parents have noticed. That is the pattern they want their son’s life to follow.</p><p>Wisdom is also described as the first thing that God created. Wisdom was with God when he created the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108215\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">world</span>. Wisdom was full of joy and delight as God created the world and all people. This shows that wisdom can also be learnt by studying <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108197\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">creation</span>.</p><p>The poems about wisdom talk about foolishness being the opposite of wisdom. Foolishness is described as a woman who knows nothing and is full of pride. She treats others badly. Like wisdom, foolishness also calls out to everyone and invites them to a feast. But obeying her instructions leads to danger, suffering, trouble, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108465\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">shame</span> and death.</p>",

The story about this is recorded in 1 Kings 3:1–15. People can also become wise by studying the world around them. This includes studying plants, animals, weather, other people and everything God made. As people study, they gain knowledge. They come to understand many things about how life works. These are lessons or patterns that they have noticed. When knowledge and understanding are combined with respect for God, they become godly wisdom.</p><p>For hundreds of years in Israel, wise people shared with others these lessons and patterns. They shared them through poems, sayings and proverbs. The poems, sayings and proverbs in this section give instruction about many different matters. These matters include anger, jealousy, arguing, food, honour, being humble and pride. They include relationships in family groups, between husbands and wives and between parents and children. They include relationships in communities, between men and women and between friends and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108370\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">neighbours</span>. They include money and relationships between rich people and poor people. They include matters of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span>, being lazy, farming, business and trade. They include justice and matters of courts and of government. They also include the mind, heart, mouth and ears of each person. All the instructions teach about doing what is right and fair.</p>",
