It included caring for people in prison and those who were treated badly. It included being faithful in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108206\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">marriage</span>. It included trusting God to provide for them instead of wanting more and more money.</p><p>The author reminded the readers to also show love to faithful church leaders. They could do this by <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">praying</span> for them and following their godly example. They could do it by bringing joy to the leaders instead of trying to cause problems.</p><p>Believers must also hold on to true teaching about God’s grace. Following <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108070\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jewish laws</span> about food wouldn’t bring them what they were hoping for. They were hoping to live with God for ever in the city of his kingdom. People can only enter God’s city through having faith in Jesus. They must be willing to suffer for having faith in him. And they can offer constant praise because God will keep his promises through Jesus.</p>",
