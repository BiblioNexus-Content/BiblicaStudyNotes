Only Jesus was nailed to the cross and died to save people from sin. Paul was describing something about believers. They no longer live in the sinful ways they used to live in. Those old ways of living are dead. Now believers have new life from Jesus. They don’t receive this new life by obeying the Law of Moses. They receive it from Jesus.

Paul explained the difference between having <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108232\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">faith</span> in God and obeying Jewish laws. Abraham was made right with God because he believed God and had faith in him.</p><p>Some Galatians tried to be made right with God by obeying Jewish laws. This meant that they would have to obey the Law of Moses completely. This was something no one could do. Paul described this like being under the curse of the law. Paul was talking about the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108380\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant curses</span>. He was talking about how no one could perfectly obey the law. He was also talking about Jesus’ death on the cross.</p><p>Being put to death on a cross was considered a curse. In this way Jesus became a curse. By doing so he set people free to receive God’s blessings. Everyone who has faith in Jesus receives <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108569\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">eternal life</span> and the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108388\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit</span>.</p>",

Paul explained that the laws about circumcision didn’t matter anymore.
