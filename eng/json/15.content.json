He allowed the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> living in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108498\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Babylon</span> to return to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108291\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Judah</span>.</p><p>Many years before, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108501\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Nebuchadnezzar</span> had forced them to leave the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108480\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">southern kingdom</span> and live in Babylon. This was the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108495\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">exile</span> of the southern kingdom.</p><p>A <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108399\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophecy</span> from the book of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108497\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Isaiah</span> had talked about the Jews returning. It said that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> would stir up Cyrus to let the Jews return (Isaiah 45:13). This means that God inspired Cyrus to make that decision.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108507\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jeremiah</span> had prophesied about the time <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> spent in Babylon (Jeremiah 29:1–9). They would be there so long that Babylon would become their home. They would have families, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span> hard and grow food. Jeremiah also prophesied that one day God would bring them back to their land (Jeremiah 29:10–14). That was the land God had promised to give them in his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108253\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant with Abraham</span>.</p><p>When that time came, most of the Jews taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar had already died. Their children and grandchildren were fully settled in Babylon. Few of them wanted to move to the land of their people from long ago. Only those whom God inspired returned. Most of these were <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108333\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">priests</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108343\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Levites</span> and people from the tribes of Judah and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108294\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Benjamin</span>.</p><p>Jews who returned were to build a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span> for God in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108464\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>. That was part of Cyrus’ order. Cyrus made sure that they had everything they needed to do this.</p><p>In the year 586 BC Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed the temple built when <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108473\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Solomon</span> was <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">king</span>. At that time Nebuchadnezzar had removed the objects used for worshipping God in the temple. Cyrus gave those objects back to the Jews who returned to Judah.</p><p>Cyrus also ordered the people to give gifts to the Jews. These gifts and offerings came from Jews who stayed in Babylon. They also came from others who lived there. This was like what happened when God rescued the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israelites</span> from being <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108258\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">slaves</span> in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108251\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Egypt</span>. At the time of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108316\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">exodus</span>, the Egyptians gave the Israelites many gifts. Later those gifts were used to make the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108334\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy tent</span>. The gifts from people in Babylon were used to make the second temple.</p>",
