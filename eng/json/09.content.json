But Hannah was only one of Elkanah’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108277\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">wives</span>.

Her <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayer</span> showed how close she was to God.

She praised God for rescuing and saving <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108418\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">needy people</span>.

The prophecy came true after a battle between the people of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> and the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108267\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Philistines</span>. The Israelites wanted God to protect them and to help them win the battle. They used the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108385\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">ark of the covenant</span> to try and force God to do this. But they weren’t obeying God or trusting him to save them. This was very different from how the ark was used in the battle against Jericho (Joshua 6:1–14).</p><p>Eli’s sons were killed in the battle with the Philistines. Eli died when he heard that the Philistines captured the ark of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span>. The Philistines suffered a plague because they had taken the ark. The plague was God’s judgement against them.

He was the last one to lead like the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108430\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">12 judges</span> had led. He helped the Israelites turn back to God. They stopped worshipping false gods and instead <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108332\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worshipped only God</span>. This showed that they were being faithful to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108328\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. Then God saved them from their enemies.

Yet none of those things mattered for their victory. Nor did it matter that the Israelites didn’t have weapons. God caused the Philistines to panic. This allowed the Israelites to have victory.</p><p>After that Saul was committed to carrying out his foolish promise to kill <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108457\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jonathan</span>.

They were to be set apart for God and completely destroyed. This was how God would bring judgement against the Amalekites. Instead, Saul kept many of their animals and allowed the king to live. All of these things showed that Saul was a foolish and proud king. He didn’t obey God’s commands about how kings should rule. He didn’t help the people to be faithful to God.</p><p>God was very sad about this and Samuel was very sad and angry. Samuel made it clear that Saul wouldn’t continue to be king over God’s people. This didn’t mean that Saul stopped ruling right away. It meant that the sons that came after Saul wouldn’t be kings. Someone from another family line would become king instead.</p>",
