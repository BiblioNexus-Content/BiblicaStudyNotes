John was the messenger who announced that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span> was coming.</p><p>John helped people realise that they were living in ways that didn’t please <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span>.

This showed that they wanted to stop <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sinning</span> and wanted to follow God’s ways.

God spoke from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108201\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heaven</span> and announced that Jesus is his Son whom he loves. The Holy Spirit came down on Jesus in the form of a dove.</p><p>Then Jesus went into the desert.

After that Jesus was ready to begin his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span>. He started by urging everybody to turn away from their sinful ways and to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repent</span>. Then he invited certain people to be his closest followers. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108040\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">disciples</span> would work together with Jesus as he brought God’s kingdom to earth.</p>",
