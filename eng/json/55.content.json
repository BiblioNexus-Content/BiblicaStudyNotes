Paul wanted Timothy to use his gift faithfully to serve the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108096\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">church</span>. He could do this by teaching the truth about <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span>.</p><p>Paul had taught Timothy how to teach the truth. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108388\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit</span> would give him the power and love he needed to do it. The truth of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108043\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">good news</span> is that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108098\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Christ</span> has broken the power of death.</p><p>Upon <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108065\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus’ return</span> to earth he will judge all things on <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108055\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement day</span>. He gives <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108569\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">eternal life</span> to those who trust in him.</p><p>Paul had been put in prison for spreading that message. Many people who had been Paul’s friends were ashamed that he was in prison. They deserted him when he was <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108054\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">treated badly</span>. But God’s Spirit gave Paul strength to face these troubles. The faith and friendship of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108077\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">believers</span> like Onesiphorus and Timothy encouraged Paul.</p>",
