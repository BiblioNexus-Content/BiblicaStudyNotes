But many chose to continue living in the lands ruled over by the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108509\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Persian</span> government. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108519\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Xerxes</span> ruled over the entire Persian kingdom. He held a banquet for other leaders in that kingdom. He showed them how rich he was and how much power he had. But Queen Vashti challenged his authority.</p><p>At that time in Persia, husbands had authority to give commands to their wives. Wives were required to obey their husband’s orders. Xerxes was very angry that the queen disobeyed him. He followed the suggestions of his advisers and attendants about what to do. A new queen would take Vashti’s place. Xerxes would choose the new queen from among a group of virgins. These young women were forced to leave their families to serve the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">king</span>. They served him by becoming <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108265\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">concubines</span>. Xerxes chose Esther to be the new queen.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108302\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> were supposed to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108206\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">marry</span> people who <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108332\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worshipped only God</span>. But Esther wasn’t given the choice whether or not to marry Xerxes. Esther’s cousin <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108520\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mordecai</span> helped her and supported her as much as he could. He warned her not to tell anyone that she was a Jew. He also warned her about plans to kill Xerxes. Esther used her authority as queen to help save Xerxes from being killed. The two officers who made the plans against Xerxes were put to death.</p>",
