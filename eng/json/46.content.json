Paul described sin and evil like yeast that spreads throughout bread dough. The Corinthian believers had lived in sinful ways before they started following Jesus. Those ways included boasting, pride, hatred, sexual sin and wanting more and more things. They included telling lies, cheating and worshipping statues of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108284\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">false gods</span>.</p><p>Paul made it very clear that believers must have nothing to do with sin. Instead, believers should live in ways that are honest and true. This is <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108044\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy living</span>. Paul described it like a new batch of dough without yeast. Bread without yeast is what <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> ate during the Passover Feast.</p><p>Paul explained how the Corinthians were to deal with believers who were proud of their sin. They were to judge them. This meant recognising the problem and taking action to stop it. They were to stay away from such people. People who were proud of their sin mustn’t be allowed to remain in the church community. This is because people who want to keep sinning aren’t serving Jesus as Lord. They are causing harm that might destroy the church. <span>And the Corinthians had to hand such people over to Satan.</span> Satan is another name for the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108216\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">devil</span>.</p><p>This meant that such people must <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repent</span> and turn away from their sin.

Paul used things they could see on earth as examples to help them understand.</p><p>A plant looks very different from the seed it grew from. This is the same as the difference between a person’s body before death and after resurrection. Human bodies are made of things God created when he made the world. In this way they are like the body God created from the dust for Adam (Genesis 2:7). That is what Paul meant about being like the earthly man.</p><p>When believers are raised from the dead, their human bodies will be changed. They will not be only a spirit. They will have bodies like Jesus’ body after he rose from the dead. That is what Paul meant about being like the heavenly man. Their new bodies will be able to do much more than their old bodies. Their new bodies will last for ever.</p><p>Paul celebrates this with a victory song. The Messiah lives and death’s power has been taken away! The way that people live while they are on earth is important. It’s important because death isn’t the end of life.</p>",
