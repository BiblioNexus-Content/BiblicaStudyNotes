The messages in chapter 2 and 3 showed something else about God. God brings judgement against all people groups for their sin. And God’s blessings are for all people groups who obey him. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108229\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God chose</span> to live in Zion.
