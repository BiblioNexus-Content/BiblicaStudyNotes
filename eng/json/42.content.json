In the story, a Jew had been attacked by robbers.</p><p>The Jewish religious leaders passed by the man but didn’t help him. They treated the man like an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108369\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">outsider</span> instead of like a neighbour. It was a man from Samaria who stopped to help. He treated the Jew who was hurt like a neighbour.

Jesus taught that people are to consider all other humans to be their neighbour. This means treating everyone with respect, love and care.

That would make him part of God’s kingdom. The man was sad because he didn’t want to give up his riches. This showed how deeply he was committed to his wealth. The ruler wanted to keep his money more than he wanted to serve God.</p><p>Many Jews believed that riches were a sign that God was pleased with them.
