He spoke some messages as <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108204\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">poems</span> and shared some messages through <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108537\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">actions of prophecy</span>.</p><p>Hosea obeyed <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span>’s instructions about who to marry and what to name their children. His <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108206\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">marriage</span> and the naming of his children were actions of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108399\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophecy</span>. Hosea married a woman who had sex with other men. She acted like a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108535\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prostitute</span>. This was a picture of how the people of the northern kingdom treated God.</p><p>God was faithful to them like Hosea was faithful to his wife Gomer. But the people weren’t faithful to God just like Gomer wasn’t faithful to Hosea. Faithfulness between Hosea and Gomer meant having sex only with each other. Faithfulness between God and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> meant that God’s people <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108332\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worshipped only God</span>. It meant that they obeyed the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108335\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Law of Moses</span> recorded in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108327\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span>.</p><p>Hosea gave his children names that meant Not Loved and Not My People. These names were a picture of how God would treat his people. He would treat them as if they weren’t his people that he loved. This means that he would treat them as if the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108327\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai</span> covenant were broken. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span> showed that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God chose</span> the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108220\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">family line</span> of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108243\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Abraham</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108261\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Isaac</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108268\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jacob</span>. He chose them to be a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108337\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kingdom of priests</span> and a holy nation. That was how God showed his love for them.</p><p>But the people of the northern kingdom worshipped the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108284\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">false god</span> called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108401\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Baal</span>. It was as if they had forgotten that God was their God. God never stopped being faithful to his people. God promised that one day <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> would recognise him as the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span>. God’s people would enjoy the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108379\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant blessings</span>. They would be led by a king from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108449\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">David</span>’s family line.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> came to understand these messages of hope as prophecies about the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108527\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">messiah</span>. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108528\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">New Testament</span> writers came to understand that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span> is the Messiah.</p>",

They hadn’t shown faithfulness to him. The way that God explained this was like bringing charges against them in court. God accused them of not being faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant.</p><p>The people and leaders of the northern kingdom didn’t honour God as God. They stole and told lies. They committed <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108223\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">murder</span> and adultery. These things went against the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108331\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ten Commandments</span>. The ways that God’s people acted brought harm to the land and animals around them. This showed that they weren’t being <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108209\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">rulers</span> of God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108197\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">creation</span> like they should be.</p><p>They burnt <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108371\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">incense</span> to false gods on <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108499\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">high places</span>. They killed <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108202\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">human beings</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108256\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrificed</span> them to false gods. This showed that God’s people didn’t recognise who God is. They didn’t recognise how he wanted to be worshipped.</p><p>The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108333\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">priests</span> didn’t lead the people in following the Law of Moses. Many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108416\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophets</span> didn’t speak the truth to the people. God’s people made fun of prophets who did speak the truth. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kings</span> and princes didn’t follow God’s rules for kings recorded in Deuteronomy 17:14–20. They depended on the strength of their large armies and the armies of other nations. They trusted nations like <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108251\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Egypt</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108493\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Assyria</span> to save them when they were attacked. They didn’t cry out to God when they needed help.</p><p>Because of all of these things, God had made a decision. He would no longer keep the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108380\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant curses</span> from coming upon them. He would allow the northern kingdom to be destroyed by the armies of Assyria. The people and leaders of the northern kingdom would suffer terribly. Many would be killed and many would be forced to leave their land. They would be forced to live in Assyria and other nations. This was the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108495\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">exile</span> of the northern kingdom.</p><p>God was very sad about this decision. He didn’t want it to happen. He wanted to bless and heal his people and give them success. But he could only do that if they changed their ways and did what was right and fair. He could do it if they recognised that he is God. He could do it if they asked him to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108281\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">forgive</span> them. That was why God sent them messages through Hosea. God understood that his people refused to turn back to him. They refused to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repent</span> of their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sin</span> with their whole <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108419\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heart</span>. But God’s heart was full of kindness, pity and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108342\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">mercy</span> towards them. He described himself as Israel’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108312\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">father</span>. God was gentle and tender towards his son. He didn’t want his son to be destroyed.</p><p>God promised something for after the time of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span>. He promised to bring his people back from exile. Then they would follow God faithfully and he would love them freely.</p>",
