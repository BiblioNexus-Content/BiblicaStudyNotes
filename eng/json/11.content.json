    "content": "<p>1 Kings continues the story of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> recorded in 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108449\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">David</span> had promised that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108473\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Solomon</span> would be <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">king</span> after him. Yet David hadn’t taken any action to appoint the next king. Nor had he guided and corrected his sons.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108474\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Adonijah</span> made himself king like <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108472\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Absalom</span> had once done. This caused a lot of confusion in Israel.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108470\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Nathan</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108468\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Bathsheba</span> convinced David to make Solomon king before David died. David’s final words to Solomon were about people who had supported or opposed him. Solomon obeyed David’s instructions about how to treat them. This included killing people who challenged Solomon’s authority as king.</p><p>David’s final words were also about Solomon living the way <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> wanted him to live. The kings after David were to be faithful to God with their whole <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108419\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heart</span>. That was part of God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108466\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant with David</span>.</p><p>When Solomon asked for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108325\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">wisdom</span>, God gave him more wisdom than any other person had. The Israelites recognised how wise Solomon was. Solomon’s wisdom was clear in the decisions he made as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108420\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judge</span> in hard cases.</p><p>Solomon’s government had control over the people groups who lived all around Israel. People from these nations also recognised how wise Solomon was. They came to hear him speak.</p><p>The Israelites lived in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108211\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">peace</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108212\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">rest</span>. They had everything they needed and weren’t treated badly by their enemies. These were some of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108379\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant blessings</span>.</p><p>The Israelites had to work very hard to support Solomon’s government. Local governors provided all the food and supplies the king used every month. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108452\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Samuel</span> had warned the Israelites that this would be the result of choosing to have a king. (1 Samuel 8:11–18).</p>",

    "content": "<p>Solomon had a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span> built for God in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108464\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>. He used supplies that the king of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108475\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Tyre</span> agreed to give him. He used a skilled worker from Tyre for everything made from bronze.</p><p>Thousands of men were forced to work preparing all the wood and stone for the temple. The temple took <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108214\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">seven</span> years to complete. The temple was ready to be used in time for the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108377\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Feast of Booths</span>. All the Israelites gathered as they offered <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108256\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrifices</span>, prayed (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayer</span>) and joyfully celebrated for 14 days.</p><p>God hadn’t asked the Israelites to build a temple for worshipping him. David and Solomon wanted to build it. God accepted their desire and used the temple like he had used the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108334\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy tent</span>. It became the place where God was present in Israel. He made this known by sending a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108321\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">cloud</span> to fill the temple. The cloud was a sign of God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108348\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">glory</span>.</p><p>What mattered most to God was that his people follow him and obey him. God reminded Solomon of this in a message. The king must set the example of being completely faithful to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108328\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108339\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">stone tablets</span> in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108385\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">ark of the covenant</span> were a record of this <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span>.</p><p>Solomon’s blessings and prayers showed something. He understood that he and the people were responsible for being faithful to God. Doing so would help other people groups realise that Israel’s God is the true God. Solomon also understood that God didn’t need a temple to live in. A building made by <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108202\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">human beings</span> can’t hold God. But the temple would help <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108302\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> remember that God was with them. They could go there to pray. Or they could turn their body towards the temple to pray. They could do this if they were far away from Jerusalem. This would help them to pray and ask God to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108281\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">forgive</span> their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sins</span>. It would help them trust that God heard them and took action to help them. This was true for the Israelites and for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108369\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">outsiders</span> who worshipped God.</p>",

But these things went against God’s rules for kings in Israel (Deuteronomy 17:14–20). They led Solomon to do evil things. He didn’t worship only God. He wasn’t faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. Because of this, God allowed enemies to attack Israel.

Rehoboam didn’t listen to wise advice about being a leader. He didn’t want to serve God’s people or take care of them. He didn’t do what was fair and right like David had done. So ten tribes stopped following him. They became the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108479\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">northern kingdom</span> and were called Israel.</p><p>Yet God was faithful to his covenant with David. He allowed David’s family line to continue ruling. Rehoboam was king over the tribes of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108291\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Judah</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108294\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Benjamin</span>. They became the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108480\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">southern kingdom</span> and were called Judah. Under Rehoboam the southern kingdom wasn’t powerful and didn’t have peace and rest.</p><p>Jeroboam was the king of the northern kingdom. God had made promises to Jeroboam like his promises to David. Jeroboam was supposed to be faithful to God like David had been. But Jeroboam didn’t believe <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108200\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s words</span>. He believed that he would lose his power if the Israelites continued worshipping God in Jerusalem. Jeroboam put golden statues in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108272\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Bethel</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108444\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Dan</span> and said that they were the true God.

Jeroboam didn’t repent of his sin and turn back to God when he heard the message. He didn’t stop living in evil ways even after God healed his hand. Later Ahijah prophesied about God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span> against Jeroboam and the northern kingdom.</p>",
