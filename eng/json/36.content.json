    "content": "<p>The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108416\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophet</span> Zephaniah brought <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108534\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">messages of judgement</span> and hope to the people of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108480\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">southern kingdom</span>. He spoke the messages as <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108204\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">poems</span>. He used <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108541\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">apocalyptic writing</span> to describe the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108571\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">day of the Lord</span>. That was a time when <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> would bring <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span>. God would bring judgement against the people groups and nations living around the southern kingdom. These included the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108267\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Philistines</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108397\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Moabites</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108412\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ammonites</span>, the people of Cush and the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108493\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Assyrians</span>. God would also bring judgement against the southern kingdom.</p><p>Zephaniah explained why the southern kingdom would be judged. The officials, rulers, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108416\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophets</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108333\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">priests</span> and merchants didn’t follow the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108335\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Law of Moses</span>. They didn’t make sure that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> were faithful to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108328\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. God brought judgement against the other nations. But the people and leaders of the southern kingdom paid no attention to it. They were committed to following the evil practices of the other nations. God’s people refused to follow the ways that God had taught them to live.</p><p>Zephaniah warned the leaders and the people of the southern kingdom. He warned them to stop being proud. He urged them to worship God faithfully and to do what God wanted done. This would show that they had turned away from their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sin</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repented</span>. In Zephaniah’s time, King <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"BSN_KeyTerms_Josiah\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Josiah</span> led the people to repent. He stopped them from worshipping <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108284\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">false gods</span>. But the people didn’t change their ways for very long.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s anger</span> against their sins was very strong. Zephaniah described it as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108345\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">jealous</span> anger that burnt like fire. Fire is used to destroy things and also to purify things. It purifies metals by burning away the scum in order to make silver. Zephaniah announced that God would purify what all the nations say. People’s words show what they believe in their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108419\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heart</span> and who they worship. This meant that God’s judgement would purify the southern kingdom and other nations. Those who were proud were like the scum that God would get rid of. The only people left alive would be those who trust in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span>. They were like the silver in a metal that has been purified.</p><p>The message of hope for these people was that they would have the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108379\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant blessings</span>. They would have everything they needed and would live in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108211\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">peace</span>. This message of hope was for people from the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108220\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">family line</span> of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108268\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jacob</span>. It was also for people from all nations who bow down to God. Bowing down to God showed that they worshipped God as the only Lord and King. The message of hope led people to sing and celebrate with joy. God would also sing for joy. He would sing over people who followed him faithfully. God would take great delight in them.</p><p>Jews came to understand this message of hope as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108399\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophecy</span> about the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108527\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">messiah</span>. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108528\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">New Testament</span> writers came to understand that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span> is the Messiah.</p>",
