Their gifts of money helped him to continue his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span> as an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108053\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">apostle</span>.</p><p>The way they gave so freely was like a gift they gave to God. It was an offering that pleased God. It also made Paul happy.</p><p>Paul went through many good times and he also went through many difficult times. He learnt how to be content when he had everything he needed. He also learnt to be content when he didn’t have what he needed. Christ gave him the strength to be content no matter what was happening to him.</p><p>Paul and the Philippians belonged to the same Lord. So Paul knew that God would make sure that the Philippians also had what they needed. God shares his wonderful riches with all who belong to Christ. Paul was talking about spiritual blessings. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108302\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> give him glory because of the wonderful gifts he shares with them.</p>",
