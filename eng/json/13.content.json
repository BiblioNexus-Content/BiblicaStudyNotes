They stop around the year 538 <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108494\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">BC</span>. That is when <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108502\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Cyrus</span> allowed <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> living in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108498\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Babylon</span> to return to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108291\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Judah</span>.</p><p>These family lines were a short way to describe the entire history of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span>. That history was told in the books of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108193\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Bible</span> from Genesis to 2 Kings. After Adam, the family lines follow many people that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God chose</span> to make a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span> with. This includes <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108230\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Noah</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108243\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Abraham</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108261\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Isaac</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108268\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jacob</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108449\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">David</span>.</p><p>The family lines also follow people groups that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> didn’t make a covenant with. This includes the families of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108262\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ishmael</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108269\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Esau</span>. These families were important in the history of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108286\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">12 tribes</span> of Israel. The family lines follow Jacob’s sons except for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108444\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Dan</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108443\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Zebulun</span>. They were part of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108479\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">northern kingdom</span>.</p><p>1 Chronicles made something clear about the tribes of the northern kingdom. They never returned from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108493\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Assyria</span>. That is where they had been forced to live in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108495\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">exile</span>. 1 Chronicles also made something clear about God. God answered people who cried out to him and trusted him for help. This was true when Jabesh prayed (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayer</span>). It was true when the tribes east of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108406\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">River Jordan</span> prayed during a battle.</p><p>The family lines focus on the tribes of Judah and of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108383\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Levi</span> and on King David. 1 Chronicles follows these family lines until the end of the exile of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108480\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">southern kingdom</span>. This helped Jews to understand something important. They had faced the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108380\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant curses</span>. They had been forced to leave the land God had given them. But God was still faithful to them. Those who had returned to Judah should remember David’s example. They should remember the example of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108343\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Levites</span> David appointed. They should obey the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108328\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span> and worship God faithfully.</p>",

This was because Saul wasn’t faithful to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span>. As a result, God took his love away from Saul. This didn’t mean that God stopped loving Saul and started hating him. It meant that God chose someone else to be the ruler of the Israelites. God chose David and his family line.</p><p>The stories about David recorded in 1 Chronicles show times when David was faithful to God. They don’t include some of the times when David wasn’t faithful. Those stories are recorded in 2 Samuel. 1 Chronicles shows how David asked God for help and for advice about fighting wars. David was an example of how to worship God with much joy. David brought order to the worship practices of the Israelites. He made sure that the Levites followed God’s commands about <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108256\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrifices</span>. Those commands were recorded in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108335\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Law of Moses</span>. David also made sure that the Levites led the people in praising God. They praised God by singing, dancing and playing instruments. The song in 1 Chronicles chapter 16 includes parts of Psalms 96, 105 and 106.</p><p>The stories about David recorded in 1 Chronicles also show something about the Israelites. The entire community supported David as king. This included a special group of mighty warriors. It included the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108307\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">elders</span> and men from all 12 tribes who could fight. It included families and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108370\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">neighbours</span> who brought food to celebrate David as king. David led the Israelites in making decisions together. He led them to make decisions that were according to what God wanted. He did this when they decided to bring the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108385\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">ark of the covenant</span> to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108464\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>. This was very different from how the Israelites made decisions in earlier times. During the time of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108430\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">12 judges</span>, the people did anything they thought was right (Judges 21:25).</p><p>David was the kind of king that the book of Judges showed was needed. David and the Israelites <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worked</span> hard to fight against people groups that attacked them. They worked hard to build the city of Jerusalem. God blessed the hard work of David and the people and made them successful. This is what the words the Lord was with him mean. It’s also what the words the Lord honoured his kingdom mean. God made David’s rule as king secure by making a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108466\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant with David</span>. God promised to never take his love away from the sons that came after David. This meant that someone from David’s family line would always be king. The Jews who returned from Babylon were waiting for that king to come and rule.</p>",

This story explains how David came to choose the place where the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span> would be built.</p><p>David had all the fighting men in Israel counted. This was considered an evil deed. It isn’t fully understood why this was wrong. Perhaps the way that David counted the men went against the instructions recorded in Exodus 30:12–16.</p><p>Later David recognised that he had <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sinned</span>. He <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repented</span>. God took away David’s guilt but still brought <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span> against him for what he had done. All of Israel suffered when God punished David.</p><p>The plague stopped when David built an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108285\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">altar</span> and made sacrifices to honour God. He did this at the threshing floor of a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108504\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jebusite</span> man. God heard David’s prayers and accepted his offering. God made this clear by sending fire from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108201\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heaven</span> to the altar. After that, David decided that the temple and its altar would be built there.</p><p>David was completely committed to having a temple built for God. He understood that God didn’t want him to be the one to build it. David made all the plans that were needed so that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108473\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Solomon</span> could build it. This included appointing workers and gathering all the wood, stone and metals. David explained all the plans to Solomon. He also explained to Solomon the covenant God had made with David’s family line.</p><p>David urged Solomon to be completely committed to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108327\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai</span> covenant. He also urged him to start building the temple. He wanted Solomon to keep working on the temple until it was finished.</p>",
