    "content": "<p>In 2 Kings 14:25 Jonah was described as a servant of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span>.</p><p>In the book of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108573\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jonah</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> wanted Jonah to share a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108534\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">message of judgement</span>. This message was against the city of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108574\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Nineveh</span>. But Jonah didn’t obey God or show respect for God. He didn’t go right away to share God’s message with the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108493\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Assyrians</span> in Nineveh. Instead, he ran away.</p><p>This was different from what the plants, animals and weather in this story did. God sent a strong wind and a huge fish. God caused a leafy plant to grow. He also sent a worm and an east wind. The plant, the animals and the wind all obeyed their Creator.</p><p>The way that Jonah treated God was also different from how the sailors treated God. The sailors weren’t <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108532\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Hebrew</span> like Jonah was. They didn’t <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108332\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worship only God</span>. But they did show respect for God. They showed it by crying out to God for help and by offering <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108256\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrifices</span> to him.</p><p>Jonah’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayer</span> was like many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108204\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">poems</span> in the book of Psalms that give thanks to God. Jonah thanked God for saving him from drowning in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108575\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mediterranean Sea</span>. Yet Jonah didn’t admit that he had done anything wrong. He didn’t say that he was sorry for not obeying God. He didn’t ask God to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108281\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">forgive</span> him.</p><p>This was different from what the king, the nobles and the people of Nineveh did. When Jonah announced God’s message of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span>, they admitted that they had done evil things. Right away they went without eating. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108456\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Fasting</span> and wearing rough clothes were common practices in that time. They were ways that people showed that they turned away from their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sin</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repented</span>. The Ninevites didn’t allow their animals to have food for a time either. The king sat in the dust. This showed that he made himself humble before God. The people stopped harming others. They repented and prayed to God with all their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108419\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heart</span>. All of these actions showed how serious the Ninevites were about changing their ways.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s anger</span> at their sin stopped. He showed them pity and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108342\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">mercy</span>.</p>",
