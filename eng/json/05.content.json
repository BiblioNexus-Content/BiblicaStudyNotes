That is where they had arrived by the end of the book of Numbers. It was at the border of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108246\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Canaan</span>. They stayed there throughout the book of Deuteronomy.</p><p>Deuteronomy is a second record of the laws of God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span> with the Israelites. The laws are recorded in the pattern of a treaty common in those times. Treaties were agreements about what each person or group was responsible for. They were common between <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kings</span> and the people they ruled over. In Deuteronomy, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> is the King and the Israelites are his people (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span>).</p><p>The laws are recorded in long messages that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108300\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Moses</span> gave before he died. Moses reminded the people about their journey and why they took it. They started at Mount Horeb. Mount Horeb was another name for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108327\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai</span>. They travelled to the land that God had promised to give <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108243\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Abraham</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108261\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Isaac</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108268\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jacob</span>.</p><p>At <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108391\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Kadesh Barnea</span>, the people refused to enter Canaan. They were afraid. They believed that God hated them. But this wasn’t true. God loved them. He made sure that they had everything they needed as they wandered in the desert.</p><p>During their journey the Israelites didn’t attack any of the people groups they were related to. This included the people of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108411\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Edom</span>, Moab and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108412\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ammon</span>. But they won battles against the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108413\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Amorites</span> and started living in their lands.</p><p>Moses prayed (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayer</span>) to God and asked God to allow him to enter Canaan. But God only allowed him to see the land. Then Moses helped <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108389\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Joshua</span> get ready to lead the Israelites into Canaan.</p>",
