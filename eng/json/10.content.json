First, he mourned for Saul and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108457\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jonathan</span>. He put to death the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108324\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Amalekite</span> who boasted about killing Saul.</p><p>David moved back to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108291\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Judah</span> from the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108267\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Philistine</span> town where he had been living. Many soldiers had been with David during the years he had run away from Saul. For several years they fought against the army that still supported Saul’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108220\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">family line</span>. That army was led by a commander named Abner. The fighting led to bitter feelings.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108463\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Joab</span> murdered Abner even though Abner had started supporting David as king. Then two soldiers who had been faithful to Saul <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108223\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">murdered</span> Saul’s son Ish-Bosheth. David made it clear that he wasn’t guilty of these deaths.</p><p>The rest of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108286\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">12 tribes</span> of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> then recognised David as their king. They made a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span> with him and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108360\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">anointed</span> him.</p><p>By this time David had many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108277\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">wives</span> and children. Later he had even more. This was very common for kings in that time. But it was against <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span>’s rules for kings of Israel (Deuteronomy 17:14–20). It led to many problems for David’s family.</p><p>David chose to make <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108464\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span> the capital city of the government of Israel. Then he made it the main centre of worship. He did this by bringing the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108385\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">ark of the covenant</span> to Jerusalem. The first time the Israelites moved the ark, God put Uzzah to death for touching the ark. David was angry about this.</p><p>Uzzah’s death reminded <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> how <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108361\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy</span> the ark of the covenant was. They had to honour it because it was God’s throne on earth. The second time the Israelites moved the ark, David celebrated and danced before the ark.</p><p>David’s wife Michal wasn’t happy about this. She didn’t think that the king should dance in front of the people he ruled over. She thought it brought <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108465\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">shame</span> on him. But David was willing to look foolish to honour God with all his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108419\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heart</span>.</p>",

The ark had been kept in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108334\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy tent</span>. The tent had moved from place to place with the Israelites since they left <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108251\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Egypt</span>.</p><p>The ark was a sign of God’s presence on earth. Through the ark, God had moved from place to place with his people. He did this so that they could trust that he was with them. God didn’t want David to build a house for him. Instead, God promised to build a royal house for David. This was a way of talking about how David’s family line would be Israel’s rulers. The sons born after him would be Israel’s kings. One of David’s sons would build a house for God. That house was the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span>.</p><p>God promised to be like a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108312\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">father</span> to the kings in David’s family line. This meant that there would always be someone from David’s family line who ruled as king. Many years later, people understood that this was a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108400\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophecy about Jesus</span>. David was surprised and amazed at God’s promises to him. He understood that these promises were a covenant. God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108466\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant with David</span> would last for ever.</p><p>David’s heart was full of thanks. He trusted that God would do what he said he would do. God also promised to give David and the Israelites <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108211\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">peace</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108212\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">rest</span> from their enemies. This happened as David won battles over the people groups around the Israelites. The Israelites finally lived in all the land that God had promised to give <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108243\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Abraham</span>.</p><p>David did what was fair and right and led the Israelites as a faithful <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108278\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">shepherd</span>. One example of this is how he treated Jonathan’s son <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108467\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mephibosheth</span>. He made sure that Mephibosheth received all the land that had belonged to Saul. He made sure that Mephibosheth always had what he needed. In this way David was faithful to Jonathan’s covenant of friendship with him (1 Samuel 23:16–18).</p>",

    "content": "<p>David’s song of praise to God is also recorded in Psalm 18. The song described times when David trusted God to save him. David understood that he had been rescued from his enemies because God was his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108319\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Saviour</span>. He understood that God was the one who gave him authority and success.</p><p>God used many people in David’s life to help him. One was the mother of some of the men David allowed the Gibeonites to kill. These Gibeonites were the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108427\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Hivites</span> that Israel had promised not to destroy. David heard about how this mother honoured the dead bodies of those men. So he had them buried with Saul and Jonathan in a way that was considered proper. Then God allowed the land to produce food again.</p><p>Other people who helped David were his officials and mighty warriors. They protected David and put their lives in danger to support him. David’s song of praise also described how deeply David <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108355\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">loved God</span>. He showed this by obeying God’s commands and living according to God’s ways.</p><p>The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108204\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">poem</span> of David’s last words also talked about this. David talked about how he used his authority to do what was right for people. Yet that wasn’t always true about David. When David didn’t do what was right and fair, this brought suffering to others. The stories of Uriah, Amnon and Absalom were examples of this. They showed that David’s family and the nation of Israel suffered because of David’s choices.</p><p>Another example was counting the fighting men in Israel’s territory. It isn’t known exactly why this was wrong. But David’s officials knew it was wrong and David realised he had sinned. It led to a plague that killed many people. David turned away from his sin and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repented</span>. He trusted God to have <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108342\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">mercy</span> on him even after he sinned.</p><p>He showed this by building an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108285\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">altar</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108338\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrificing animals</span>. Then God stopped the plague and sent blessing instead. Later, the temple was built in the place where David built that altar.</p>",
