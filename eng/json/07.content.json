    "content": "<p>The book of Judges continues the story of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> recorded in the book of Joshua.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> had done many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108305\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">miracles</span> when he gave <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108246\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Canaan</span> to the Israelites. That is the main point of the book of Joshua.</p><p>Along with God’s amazing deeds, the Israelites were supposed to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span> hard to possess the land. They were also supposed to stay faithful to God. But they didn’t work as hard as they should have. And they weren’t faithful. That is the main point of the book of Judges.</p><p>The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108428\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">angel of the Lord</span> told the Israelites the evil things they had done. The people were sad about the evil things they had done. But they didn’t stop doing them.</p><p>Judges describes the pattern of how the Israelites acted and what happened to them. This was the pattern of sin, suffering and salvation. First they <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sinned</span> by turning away from God. This included worshipping <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108284\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">false gods</span> called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108401\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Baal</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108429\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ashtoreth</span>.</p><p>It also included <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108206\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">marrying</span> into Canaanite families and living as a community with them. This meant that the Israelites no longer lived as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108337\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kingdom of priests</span>. They no longer lived as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108361\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy</span> nation.</p><p>Next the Israelites suffered. God brought <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span> against them for breaking the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108328\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. He allowed them to experience some of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108380\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant curses</span>.</p><p>When this happened the Israelites <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repented</span> and turned back to God. Then God brought <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108196\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">salvation</span> to his people (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108302\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span>) through certain leaders. These leaders were the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108430\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">12 judges</span>. The judges freed the Israelites from the power of their enemies.</p><p>Once they were saved, the Israelites sinned again by turning away from God. The book of Judges records the stories of this pattern happening again and again.</p>",
