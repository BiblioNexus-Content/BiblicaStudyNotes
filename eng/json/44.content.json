Jesus spent time with his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108040\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">disciples</span> after he rose from the dead. The disciples were also called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108053\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">apostles</span>.

They still thought Jesus was going to make <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> a powerful nation again. Jesus’ final instructions to them were to wait until they were <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108037\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">baptised</span> with the Holy Spirit. He was talking about when he would send the Holy Spirit to his followers. Their lives would be completely changed when this happened.
