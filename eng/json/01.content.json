They lived in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108207\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Garden of Eden</span>. God gave them <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108208\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">work</span> to do.

This was a way of talking about the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108216\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">devil</span>.</p><p>The snake tempted Adam and Eve to disobey God. They stopped trusting in God. Instead they chose to do something that went against what God wanted. They ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. That was the first sin. The result was that they realised they were naked. Then they were afraid and they hid from God.</p><p>Life on earth was no longer the way God wanted it to be. There was no longer complete peace between people, God and the earth. Earlier God had told Adam and Eve to have children. They were to farm the land and take care of it. But now having children would be painful. Farming the land would be hard. People would die because they couldn’t eat from the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108217\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">tree of life</span>. And the snake would always be the enemy of human beings.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that animals that are snakes are evil. It means that the devil and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108218\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">evil spiritual beings</span> are enemies. They are enemies of God and everything else that God created. All of creation was put under a curse because of sin. All of creation was made to suffer. But God’s words to Eve include a promise.
