New birth was a way to talk about when believers are <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108089\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">born again</span>. The believers’ part in the covenant is to obey Jesus <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108098\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Christ</span>.

He is their living hope.

In the first churches, it was common for women to become believers before men did. This gave a wife the opportunity to show her husband how much Jesus changes people.</p><p>Peter taught that a wife’s real beauty doesn’t come from the way she looks. It comes from the hope she has in God. This hope makes her full of gentleness instead of full of fear. Real authority for a husband doesn’t come from forcing his wife to do things. It comes from honouring her as equal before God. The husband must use his strength to protect and care for his wife.</p><p>Both men and women who are believers receive God’s gift of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108569\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">eternal life</span>. Because of this, Peter taught all the believers to be humble toward one another. They mustn’t do wrong to people who do wrong to them. Instead they were to offer kind words and love. This was one way to do good deeds that unbelievers would notice.</p>",
