He may have been talking about his age or about being a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108096\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">church elder</span>.</p><p>He was full of joy because his friend Gaius’ <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108462\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">spiritual</span> life was going well. This meant that Gaius was following <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span> faithfully.</p><p>In 1 John 3:18 John wrote about <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108077\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">believers</span> putting their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108232\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">faith</span> and love into action. Gaius did that by welcoming and helping believers who were traveling. In this way he supported people who spread the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108043\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">good news</span> about Jesus.</p><p>This was very different from what a man named Diotrephes did. Diotrephes ruled over others in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108096\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">church</span>. This went against <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108572\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Peter’s</span> instructions for church leaders (1 Peter 5:3).</p><p>Diotrephes told lies about John. John planned to speak to Diotrephes about what he was doing wrong. His plan agreed with what <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108102\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Paul</span> taught about correcting <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108118\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">church elders</span> in 1 Timothy 5:20.</p><p>John wanted Gaius to avoid doing evil and instead to do good. Demetrius was an example of a believer who did good. He was faithful to the truth about Jesus.</p>",
