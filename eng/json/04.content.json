These were men who could fight in battles. Moses counted the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108343\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Levite</span> males who were 30 to 50 years old. Moses also counted the males one month old or older in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108383\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Levi</span>’s tribe.</p><p>Then he counted the eldest sons in the other tribes. All Israelite males who were born first in their family belonged to God. The reason for this was explained in Exodus 11:1 – 13:16. This didn’t mean that God wanted the Israelites to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108264\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sacrifice children</span>. Instead, the Levite males took the place of the eldest sons from other tribes. They did this by being <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108358\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">set apart</span> to serve God.</p><p>Levite males from Aaron’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108220\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">family line</span> were set apart to serve God as <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108333\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">priests</span>. Others were responsible for taking care of the different parts of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108334\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy tent</span>.</p><p>The holy tent was in the centre of the Israelite camp. The tribes were arranged in order around it. First were the Levites who camped closest to the holy tent. Then came the tribe of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108291\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Judah</span>. They were the lead tribe and had the most soldiers. After that were the other Israelite tribes.</p><p>People who were considered <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108363\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">unclean</span> couldn’t be near the tent. They couldn’t even stay in the camp. This reminded the Israelites that God is <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108361\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy</span> and was present with them.</p>",

The words of the priests to the people were another serious matter. God commanded them to speak words of blessing. The priests’ words would help the Israelites trust that God was with them.

It was to be divided among the tribes by <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108404\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">casting lots</span>.</p><p>Each family group would receive land based on how many people were in the family. Land would be given to daughters if there were no sons in the family. This was the case with <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108405\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Zelophehad’s daughters</span>. Daughters who received land would marry men in their own tribe. That way the land wouldn’t be lost to the tribe.</p><p>The borders God described didn’t include the lands the Israelites had taken from Sihon and Og. Yet some Israelites were allowed to stay east of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108406\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">River Jordan</span>. This included the tribes of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108407\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Reuben</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108408\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Gad</span> and half of the tribe of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108299\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Manasseh</span>.</p><p>The men of these tribes would go into Canaan with the other tribes. They would help them <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108409\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">drive out</span> the people already living there. Then they would return to their homes east of the River Jordan.</p><p>Canaan would be divided among all the other tribes except the tribe of Levi. The Levites would receive towns and fields throughout the other tribes’ territories. Six of their towns would be <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108410\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">safe cities</span>.</p><p>The Israelites’ land was to be considered pure and clean. This was because the holy God wanted to live among them. But the land would be polluted and impure if people committed <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108223\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">murder</span>. It would also be impure if the Israelites worshipped false gods and didn’t <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108332\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worship only God</span>. That would happen if they didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived there already.</p>",
