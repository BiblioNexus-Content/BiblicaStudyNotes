    "content": "<p>Jeremiah’s judgement messages explained how and why <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108302\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> would be judged. These messages were like the judgement messages that <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108497\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Isaiah</span> shared.</p><p>The work of being a prophet was very hard for Jeremiah. He wept and suffered with deep sadness and pain. Inside his own body he felt <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108500\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s anger</span> like a burning fire. The people and leaders of the southern kingdom hadn’t been faithful to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108328\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. They didn’t obey the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108331\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Ten Commandments</span>. They didn’t treat others the way God taught them to in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108335\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Law of Moses</span>. They treated <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108418\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">needy people</span> badly. They worshipped <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108284\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">false gods</span> instead of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108332\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worshipping only God</span>. They felt no <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108465\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">shame</span> about this. They expected God to continue blessing them. This showed that they not only spoke lies but also lived out lies. It showed that they had no sense or <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108325\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">wisdom</span>.</p><p>They hadn’t learnt from the example of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108479\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">northern kingdom</span>. They hadn’t learnt from times in the past when God brought judgement against them. Storks and other birds had more wisdom than God’s people did. God’s people didn’t serve him with all their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108419\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heart</span>. God described this as not being <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108257\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">circumcised</span> in their hearts. Their bodies were circumcised. So on the outside of their bodies they had the sign of God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span>. But the choices they made showed that they didn’t respect and honour God. This was true for both the people and the leaders of the southern kingdom. The kings, priests and prophets didn’t follow God’s example for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108209\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">rulers</span>. They didn’t know God’s laws and didn’t lead the people in obeying God. They lied by saying that everything was going well and that the nation had <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108211\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">peace</span>. As a result of this, God would no longer stop the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108380\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant curses</span> from coming.</p><p>God longed to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108281\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">forgive</span> his people. He wanted them to turn away from their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sin</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108346\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">repent</span> and follow him. But they refused. So God told Jeremiah to stop <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">praying</span> that God would have <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108342\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">mercy</span> on them. God would use the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108498\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Babylonian</span> army as <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108415\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">his tool</span> to judge the southern kingdom. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span> would be destroyed. The people would be thrown out of the land God had given them. God had warned <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108473\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Solomon</span> about this judgement (1 Kings 9:6–9). Yet God promised that he wouldn’t destroy his people completely. He would always allow a few to remain alive. In this way God would remain faithful to his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108466\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant with David</span>.</p><p>God also gave Jeremiah messages of hope to share about a time in the future. God would live with his people and rule the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108215\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">world</span> from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108464\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span> as King. The northern and southern kingdoms would live together in their land as one kingdom again. God would return all nations to their own lands. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> would teach other nations that God is the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span> who rules over all. Every nation would be invited to follow the practices God taught his people. Every people group that honoured God would become part of God’s people.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jeremiah shared God’s judgement messages again and again in many ways. Some he shared through an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108537\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">action of prophecy</span>. This was the case with the linen belt and the clay jar from the potter. It was also the case with how Jeremiah wasn’t to get <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108206\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">married</span> or have children.</p><p>Other messages Jeremiah spoke as <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108204\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">poems</span> or simply when talking with someone. This was the case when he spoke with Pashhur and the officials sent by Zedekiah. God compared his people to many different things in his messages. This gave his people pictures to help them understand what he wanted to say. He compared them to wineskins, clay being shaped by a potter and baskets of figs. He compared them to a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108535\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prostitute</span> and to a wife who wasn’t faithful to her husband. In that picture, God was the husband. The people and leaders of the southern kingdom were the wife. Worshipping false gods was how they were unfaithful to him.</p><p>God compared the leaders to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108278\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">shepherds</span>. In that picture, the people were God’s sheep. The kings, priests and prophets were shepherds who destroyed and scattered them. Sometimes God sent his messages with a sign. This was the case when God didn’t let it rain for a time. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108550\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">False prophets</span> shared messages that weren’t from God. Their messages were lies about peace and good times. This made God very angry.</p><p>Jeremiah shared God’s messages faithfully. God had warned Jeremiah that the people and leaders would fight against him. This happened many times. People refused to listen to Jeremiah and they made fun of him. They made evil plans against him, beat him and put him in prison. God had promised to be with Jeremiah. God had promised to save him from those who treated him badly. But Jeremiah was suffering terribly. He felt that God had tricked him when he promised to be with him. Yet Jeremiah remained faithful to God as he suffered. In this way he was like <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108524\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Job</span>.</p><p>Jeremiah was honest with God when he prayed. His prayers were like the poems and songs in the book of Psalms. They included cries for help and complaining. Jeremiah also praised God and talked about how he trusted in God. The message of hope in chapter 23 talked about a king from the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108220\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">family line</span> of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108449\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">David</span>. He wouldn’t be like the greedy kings of the southern kingdom. He would follow God’s rules for kings recorded in Deuteronomy 17:14–20. This king was called a godly Branch. Isaiah had prophesied about this Branch as well (Isaiah 11:1–3).</p><p>Jews came to understand this message of hope as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108399\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophecy</span> about the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108527\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">messiah</span>. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108528\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">New Testament</span> writers came to understand it as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108400\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophecy about Jesus</span>. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span> is the Branch who makes people <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108254\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">right with God</span>.</p>",

He lived in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108495\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">exile</span> in Babylon. He told the Jews in Babylon messages that went against Jeremiah’s messages.</p><p>These examples show something about the people and leaders of the southern kingdom.

God wanted them to accept that the exile was the judgement he had promised to bring. He wanted them to accept how long it would last. They would show they accepted these things by making Babylon their home. They would make it their home by building houses, having families and planting gardens.

God would do that after 70 years.</p><p>But the Jews in Babylon didn’t want to accept these things. They wanted to pretend that they would be back in Judah very soon. They wanted to pretend that life in Judah would be better than life in Babylon. This was a way of pretending that God wasn’t bringing judgement against his people.

But they would trust God to take care of this problem. God would take care of it by forgiving their sins and their evil ways. Unlike the judgement messages, these messages of hope were pleasant for Jeremiah. He bought a piece of land as a sign. It was a sign that God’s people would buy and sell land again in the future. It was a sign that God’s promises in the messages of hope would come true.</p><p>Jews recognised that some of the promises came true after the exile. They came to understand that some of the promises would come true in the future. That would happen when the messiah came. New Testament writers showed that Jesus put the new covenant into effect. Jesus made it possible for people to be freed from the power of sin and evil.</p>",

    "content": "<p>These chapters are a collection of stories from Jeremiah’s life. They include events from Jehoiakim’s rule through the time after Jerusalem was destroyed.</p><p>These stories show something about the people and leaders of the southern kingdom. They didn’t pay any attention to what the Lord had said through Jeremiah. This was true before the Babylonian government took control of the southern kingdom and after.</p><p>The story about Rekab’s family line gave an example of faithfully obeying. Rekab’s family line faithfully obeyed the instructions of Rekab’s son Jehonadab. God used their ability to obey as an example. Compared to Rekab’s family, it was clear that God’s people refused to obey him.</p><p>Another example of this was what King Jehoiakim did after hearing God’s messages. Baruch was a secretary. He wrote down on scrolls the messages that Jeremiah had spoken for many years. Jehoiakim burnt the scrolls and tried to arrest Jeremiah and Baruch. Baruch wrote them down again with even more messages.</p><p>Later, other officials arrested Jeremiah. Some tried to kill him so that he would stop speaking God’s messages. King Zedekiah asked Jeremiah for advice. He asked Jeremiah to pray for him. Jeremiah gave him instructions about being humble and serving the king of Babylon. But Zedekiah and his officials didn’t follow those instructions. Nor did they obey the instructions in the Law of Moses about <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108258\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">slaves</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108378\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">servants</span>. They had promised to free their slaves but then changed their mind.</p><p>Because of these things, God allowed Nebuchadnezzar to fully destroy Jerusalem. The Babylonians treated Jeremiah well and set him free. Gedaliah was a leader who paid attention to God’s messages. He understood that the southern kingdom was supposed to serve Babylon. As governor of Judah that is what he led the people to do. But an officer from David’s family line killed Gedaliah. Then a large group of those left in the southern kingdom ran away to Egypt. They thought that they would be safe from Babylon’s armies there.</p><p>Jeremiah warned them not to do this. But this group forced Jeremiah and Baruch to go with them to Egypt. In Egypt this group of Jews worshipped a false god called the Queen of Heaven. They believed that Jerusalem had been destroyed because for a time they had stopped worshipping her. This showed that they hadn’t listened to Jeremiah or understood God’s messages at all. God had promised that Baruch wouldn’t be killed when trouble came to Jerusalem. It isn’t known what happened to Jeremiah and Baruch in Egypt.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In chapter 25, Jeremiah had announced that God would judge the Babylonians. The full messages of judgement against Babylon are recorded in chapters 50 and 51. Jeremiah wrote these messages down on a scroll. Baruch’s brother was to read them out loud in Babylon. Then he was to sink the scroll in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108554\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">River Euphrates</span>. This was an action of prophecy. It was a sign that God would carry out what the messages talked about.</p><p>Jeremiah announced these judgement messages even before Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem. The Babylonian armies were God’s tool for bringing judgement against other nations. But the people and leaders of Babylon didn’t recognise the real reason they had success. God’s power gave them success. Instead, the Babylonians honoured their false gods. They made themselves rich by treating other people groups badly. They worked hard to make their walls thick and high. This showed that they trusted their government and military to keep them safe.</p><p>God talked about Babylon reaching all the way to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108201\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">heavens</span>. This was a way to describe how proud they were. This was like the tower built in the city called Babel (Genesis 11:1–9). The people building that tower wanted it to reach to the sky. God made it clear that reaching to the heavens wouldn’t keep Babylon safe.</p><p>Three times God urged his people to run away from Babylon. He didn’t want them to be destroyed along with Babylon. Babylon would have done to it what it had done to others. This agreed with a law from the Law of Moses recorded in Leviticus 24:19. Everything in heaven and earth would rejoice when Babylon was punished. This was because Babylon had caused so many people and places to suffer. They would be glad when Babylon could no longer cause harm.</p><p>Some of God’s promises to punish Babylon came true when <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108509\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Persia</span> took control of Babylon. New Testament writers understood that some of the promises would come true in the future. In Revelation chapter 18, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108542\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">John</span> talked about these messages of judgement against Babylon. John used Babylon as a way to talk about other proud governments. Babylon was the example of how God would punish governments that treated God’s people badly.</p>",
