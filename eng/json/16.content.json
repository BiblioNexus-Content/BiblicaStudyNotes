    "content": "<p>In <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108515\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Nehemiah</span>’s time, many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> had already moved back to the land of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108291\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Judah</span>. They moved back from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108498\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Babylon</span> where they had been forced to live in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108495\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">exile</span>.</p><p>They were back in the land <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God</span> had given to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108220\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">family line</span> of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108243\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Abraham</span>. But the people of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span> were no longer in charge. They weren’t the rulers of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108479\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">northern kingdom</span> or the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108480\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">southern kingdom</span>. The entire land of Israel was controlled by the government of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108509\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Persia</span>.</p><p>The Jews who moved back built a new <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span>. This showed that they were <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108332\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">worshipped only God</span>. This was part of living as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108337\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">kingdom of priests</span> and a holy nation.</p><p>Yet the wall of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108464\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span> was still broken down. This showed that they were no longer a strong nation. They weren’t strong like when <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108449\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">David</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108473\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Solomon</span> were kings. The broken wall was a sign of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span> God brought against his people.</p><p>They hadn’t been faithful to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108328\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. So they faced the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108380\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant curses</span>. Nehemiah’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108227\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prayer</span> showed that he understood this. In his deep sadness, Nehemiah went without food. This is called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108456\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">fasting</span>. He prayed constantly and admitted to God how the Israelites had <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108195\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">sinned</span>.</p><p>All of God’s people had done evil things. Nehemiah recognised that this included himself and his family. In his prayer Nehemiah remembered things that were true about God. God is always faithful to his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108237\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant</span>. Nehemiah asked God to keep his promises to his people. God’s people took delight in bringing honour to God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108225\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">name</span>. Yet the broken wall of Jerusalem brought them <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108465\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">shame</span>. So Nehemiah made careful plans to rebuild the wall. He asked God to give him success when he told <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108516\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Artaxerxes</span> his plans.</p>",

This helped Nehemiah have success when he made his request to Artaxerxes. God also helped Nehemiah have success when he talked with Artaxerxes. The king allowed Nehemiah to travel to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls of the city. Artaxerxes provided everything Nehemiah needed to accomplish the task.</p><p>The Jews in Jerusalem didn’t know Nehemiah’s plans. First Nehemiah explained how much God used Artaxerxes to help him. Then the Jews were ready to join him in the work.</p><p>Some people opposed the work of rebuilding the wall. This included Sanballat, Tobiah and Geshem. They were officials from other people groups who lived in and around Jerusalem. They falsely accused Nehemiah. They said that Nehemiah was going against the authority of the Persian government. They said this because the wall would help Jerusalem be a strong military fort. It would help protect the people inside from being attacked.</p><p>But Nehemiah’s desire to rebuild the wall came from God. It wasn’t based on wanting to have power for himself and to fight against Artaxerxes. Nehemiah didn’t want those officials to be part of the community in Jerusalem. He didn’t want them to be part of the worship practices in the temple. The reasons for this are explained in other stories about them (Nehemiah chapters 4 and 6). They were <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108369\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">outsiders</span> who wanted to control Jerusalem and the Jews.</p><p>Outsiders who were completely committed to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span> could be part of the community of God’s people.

All the stories mentioned in the prayer are recorded in other books of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108193\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Bible</span>. They are recorded in the books from Genesis through 2 Chronicles.</p><p>The Jews remembered when God told <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108243\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Abraham</span> to move from Babylon to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108246\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Canaan</span>.
