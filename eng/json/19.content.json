It describes two ways of living. People choose which way they want to live.</p><p>One way of living is to obey God. This is the way to live well. It leads to enjoying the blessings that God has promised to give. For the Israelites (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108280\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Israel</span>), obeying God meant obeying the law of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108226\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Lord</span>. This was the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108328\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Mount Sinai covenant</span> recorded in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108335\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Law of Moses</span>. Being faithful to it led to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108379\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant blessings</span>.</p><p>God’s laws helped the Israelites understand what God wanted his people (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108199\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">God’s people</span>) to do. People who want to be blessed by God do what God wants done. This leads them to a life full of joy. These people are like healthy trees that bear good fruit. They are strong and steady no matter what happens. God provides for them like a stream provides water for a tree.</p><p>The other way of living is to refuse to obey God. It’s making a choice to do evil things. It’s a way that destroys people and leads to death. God brings <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108233\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">judgement</span> against those who choose this way. Many years later <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108219\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jesus</span> also talked about these two ways of living in Matthew 7:13–23.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Psalm 2 is a poem for nations. It’s about God’s blessings and promises. It’s also about the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108330\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">king</span> God <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108358\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">set apart</span> to rule over the nations.</p><p>Psalm 2 describes two ways that nations can choose to live. One way is to respect God and to serve him. This is the wise choice and is the way that nations live well. Choosing this way means that nations do what God wants done. Their leaders obey God and recognise that God is the ruler who has complete authority. They recognise that only God has the power to keep their nation safe. God wants all nations and all people groups to follow him. All nations who choose to follow him are blessed.</p><p>The other way of living is to refuse to obey God. This leads to nations being judged and destroyed. Choosing this way means that the nations don’t accept God’s authority or follow his commands. Instead, they do evil things. This makes God angry. These nations don’t obey the king that God appointed. God called himself the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108312\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">father</span> of this king. In this way the king was considered to be the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108526\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">son of God</span>. God gave this king authority over all nations.</p><p>The Israelites understood that the psalm was talking about God’s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108466\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">covenant with David</span>. It was talking about kings from the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108220\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">family line</span> of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108449\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">David</span>. Psalm 72 described what kind of rulers these kings should be. They should judge fairly and do what was right. They should punish those who did evil. Kings from David’s family line ruled in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108464\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>.</p><p>Psalm 2 talks about God’s holy mountain of Zion. Zion was another name for Jerusalem. It was <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108361\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">holy</span> because the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108417\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">temple</span> was there. But the armies of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108498\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Babylon</span> destroyed Jerusalem and the temple. After that, no more kings from David’s family line ruled.</p><p>So the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108503\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Jews</span> came to understand Psalm 2 as a promise for a future time. They were waiting for God to send a king who would rule as God’s son. They called this king the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108527\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">messiah</span>. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108528\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">New Testament</span> writers understood that Psalm 2 was a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108400\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">prophecy about Jesus</span>. This was talked about in Matthew 3:17, Acts 4:23–26 and Acts 13:32–33.</p>",

They were like strong bulls, roaring lions, wild oxen and a pack of dogs. God was the only one who could rescue him from these enemies. The speaker boldly asked God why God hadn’t saved him yet.</p><p>This psalm also helped people trust God. The speaker trusted God to rescue him even though it hadn’t happened yet. He was completely sure God would do it. He knew that later he would tell others what God had done for him. This announcement would fill people with hope. It would help others praise, honour and worship God.</p>",

This was like being sent away from God and having the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108388\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit</span> taken from them.</p><p>God provided several ways for the Israelites to be made clean and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108364\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">pure</span>. One way was to dip a hyssop plant into <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108359\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">special water</span>. Then the water would be sprinkled on someone to wash them (Numbers 19).

It went against the pattern described by parts of the Law of Moses.

The speaker didn’t want anything on earth besides God. This means that they didn’t trust in anything or anyone but God to rescue them.

Jesus showed that he is the lord that the psalm talked about (Matthew 22:41–46). New Testament writers understood this as well (Acts 2:33–36). Jesus is the priest and king God made the promises of Psalm 110 about. The writer of Hebrews showed how this was true (Hebrews 6:20 – 7:28).</p>",

It’s because God heard their cry for help and took action to save them.</p><p>This psalm has many things in common with Psalm 22. First, the speaker recognises things that are true about God. This includes God being full of tender love. Second, the speaker describes how they felt when they were suffering. They were sad, terrified and in great pain. Third, the speaker trusted in God even when they were facing danger.</p><p>What is different from Psalm 22 is that God has already rescued the speaker. That is why they are thanking God. They show that they are thankful in many ways. They worship God and offer a sacrifice. They tell others what God has done for them. They keep their promises to God and serve him faithfully.</p>",

It accused God of breaking his covenant with David. This was because God didn’t protect the king from David’s family line or his city. That city was Jerusalem.</p><p>The speakers of Psalm 137 never wanted to forget Jerusalem. God had promised to put his name in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 6:6).

These songs were called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"209393\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">new songs</span>.
